### Games, desktop app and Flatpak

Contributed by [@henningnorden](https://github.com/henningnorden) for sim racing on Linux gaming systems
(Bazzite, tested with AirPods Pro 2 in Assetto Corsa and ETS2):

- **Games page:** tick a Steam game running through Proton and its camera follows your head,
  without opentrack and without launch options. MousePods places a small TrackIR/FreeTrack DLL
  (`native/`) in the game's Proton prefix; the game reads the head pose from a file MousePods
  writes. Unticking puts back whatever tracker was set up before.
- **Per-game profiles:** damping, range and response curve per axis, axes on/off, and a neck
  model (computed from the head rotation, AirPods cannot measure leaning). **Calibrate** shows
  one point at a time full screen on the monitors you play that game on; hold still at each and
  MousePods measures how far you turn your head, so a small monitor and three monitors both work.
- **Desktop app:** own window, tray icon, autostart at login, first-run wizard; packaged as a
  Flatpak (`packaging/flatpak/`, built by GitHub Actions). Bluetooth works without
  `bluetoothctl` through BlueZ over D-Bus.
- **Languages:** English and German besides French (`ui/i18n/`).

Install: download `MousePods-flatpak` from the latest successful
[build](https://github.com/starman-tech/mousepods/actions/workflows/build.yml) and run
`flatpak install --user MousePods.flatpak`. Steam installed as a Flatpak is not supported yet.

## What's new here

Before this project, **no public tool could get head-tracking data out of AirPods 3**. LibrePods, librepods-rs, pods-head-tracker,
airpods-head-track and aap-head-tracker all list them as untested or unsupported. The reason turned out to be three
things nobody had written down:

| Finding | |
|---|---|
| AirPods 3 **ignore** the SensorDataWX protocol that AirPods Pro 2/3/4 and AirPods 4 use | [§2](docs/DISCOVERIES.md#2-airpods-3-do-not-speak-sensordatawx) |
| They expose their sensors as **virtual HID devices through Apple RemoteHID** (RTBuddy channel `0x800`). The wire format is now fully documented | [protocol](docs/REMOTEHID-PROTOCOL.md) |
| At the Linux default L2CAP MTU (672), the motion sensors are **not announced at all**. They appear at 2582, the value iOS uses | [§6](docs/DISCOVERIES.md#6-the-mtu-hides-the-sensors) |

Along the way: the complete AirPods 3 sensor catalog (`devmotion6`, `accel`, `gyro`, `cma`, `kadabra`…), sample rates up to
**~210 Hz** instead of 25 Hz, the scales of the motion block, and how the buds power their sensors on and off.
**→ All findings, with evidence and an honest "not isolated yet" list: [docs/DISCOVERIES.md](docs/DISCOVERIES.md).**

## How it works

```
 AirPods 3 ──── L2CAP 0x1001 (AACP, MTU 2582) ────▶ AAPClient ──▶ MotionEngine ──▶ Controller ──▶ /dev/uinput ──▶ cursor
   │  HostConnect ◀─────────────────────────────────┤             gyro + gravity     souris / pointeur        (Wayland, X11)
   │  DeviceConnect ×8 (HID descriptors) ──────────▶│             → yaw · pitch · roll    / glisse
   │  SetReport feature 1 = 10 000 µs ◀─────────────┤                                       │
   │  InputReport @ 100 Hz (58-byte block) ────────▶│                         http://127.0.0.1:8737  (app)
 AirPods Pro 2 ── same, through SensorDataWX (protobuf, 0x100000) ──┘
```

1. **Connect** without root: L2CAP PSM `0x1001`, encrypted link, receive MTU 2582.
2. **Start the sensor**: RemoteHID for AirPods 3, SensorDataWX for AirPods Pro / 4. Detected automatically.
3. **Compute motion that doesn't depend on how the bud is held**: yaw is the rotation around the *vertical* (taken from the gravity vector), pitch the rotation around a lateral axis learned during calibration. Gyro bias is re-estimated whenever the device is still.
4. **Move the cursor** through a virtual `uinput` device (works on Wayland), rendered at 120 Hz with One-Euro smoothing.

## Modes

| Mode | Move | Feels like |
|---|---|---|
| **Souris** (mouse) | turn / tilt your head, or a bud in your hand | an air mouse, with acceleration |
| **Pointeur** (pointer) | aim at the screen | a laser pointer. Calibrated by aiming at two corners: aim at a corner and the cursor lands there |
| **Glisse** (glide) | slide a bud flat on the table | an inertial mouse. Experimental: see the limits below |

Clicks: stem press, quick head tilt (optional), or dwell. Shortcuts: `Ctrl+Alt+C` recenter · `Ctrl+Alt+P` pause · `Ctrl+Alt+M` mode · `Ctrl+Alt+S` scroll.

## The app

A local app in the style of macOS Settings (light and dark): battery rings, live 3D orientation, rate charts, every setting applied
live, guided calibration, a **sensor explorer** to start and query each RemoteHID device, the AirPods' internal settings and a raw packet log.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/starman-tech/mousepods && cd mousepods
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python airpods_mouse_controller.py --ui            # opens the app, starts the controller
.venv/bin/python airpods_mouse_controller.py --install-hotkeys   # GNOME shortcuts (optional)
```

Requirements: Linux with BlueZ, AirPods paired and connected, write access to `/dev/uinput` (granted to the logged-in user by
`uaccess` on most desktop distributions). No root.

```bash
.venv/bin/python airpods_mouse_controller.py --diag          # live rates in the terminal, no cursor control
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests               # 159 tests, no hardware needed
```

### Immutable distros (Bazzite, Fedora Atomic): use a distrobox

On Bazzite the host Python cannot build `evdev` (no wheel on PyPI, and no `Python.h` on the
read-only system), and Homebrew's Python has no `socket.AF_BLUETOOTH`. A Fedora distrobox has
both. It shares Bluetooth, `/dev/uinput` and your home directory with the host.

```bash
distrobox create -n mousepods -i registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora-toolbox:43 -Y
distrobox enter mousepods
sudo dnf install -y python3-devel gcc
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/distrobox-host-exec /usr/local/bin/bluetoothctl   # use the host's bluetoothctl
git clone https://github.com/starman-tech/mousepods && cd mousepods
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python airpods_mouse_controller.py --ui
```

Without the `bluetoothctl` link (or `sudo dnf install bluez` inside the box) MousePods cannot list
the paired AirPods and says so. Tested on Bazzite with AirPods Pro 2. SteamOS 3.5+ ships distrobox
too, so the same steps should work there in Desktop Mode (untested).

**Proton games (Assetto Corsa tested):** run the Windows build of opentrack inside the game's
Proton prefix with [opentrack-launcher](https://github.com/markx86/opentrack-launcher): set the
game's Steam launch option to `$HOME/.local/bin/opentrack-launcher %command%` (exactly one
`%command%`). In opentrack: input *UDP over network* port 4242, output *freetrack 2.0 Enhanced*
with *Enable both*. Assetto Corsa follows the head in the cockpit camera.

### macOS (CoreMotion)

macOS keeps the AirPods' control channel to itself, so the Linux L2CAP path cannot run there. Instead a small
Swift helper (`macos/`) reads Apple's headphone motion API (`CMHeadphoneMotionManager`) and feeds the same
motion engine. Works with AirPods that support head tracking (AirPods Pro, AirPods 3 and later, AirPods Max).

```bash
macos/build.sh                                   # Swift tests, then macos/build/MousePodsMotion.app
uv tool install --editable /path/to/mousepods    # once: puts `mousepods` on your PATH
mousepods --diag                                 # live rates, no cursor control
mousepods                                        # mouse control (starts paused)
mousepods resume                                 # also: pause, toggle, recenter, quit
mousepods menu                                   # interactive overview: arrows/Tab move, Space switches
mousepods status                                 # what is on
mousepods on hands tilt                          # switch features live: hands, stem, dwell, tilt
mousepods off dwell
```

* **Permissions.** *Motion & Fitness* for "MousePods Motion" (asked on first start). *Accessibility* for the
  terminal app you run MousePods from (System Settings, Privacy & Security, Accessibility), so the cursor can move.
  Ad-hoc builds may lose the Motion permission after a rebuild; sign with a stable identity to avoid that:
  `MOUSEPODS_SIGN_IDENTITY="MousePods Dev" macos/build.sh`.
* **Rate.** About 25 Hz, fixed by the API (the Linux path reaches 100 to 210 Hz). The cursor is still drawn at 120 Hz.
* **Axes.** CoreMotion uses one head frame for every model, so a built-in profile works before calibration.
* **Displays.** Mouse mode crosses all displays; pointer mode maps head aim onto one canvas spanning all of them.
* **Shortcuts.** Control+Option+C recenter, P pause, S scroll, M mode (registered by the helper, no permission needed).
* **Clicks.** Stem press (single = left, double = right, triple = scroll): the helper becomes the *Now Playing* app
  while mouse control is active and gives play/pause back to music apps on pause. Dwell click and head-tilt click
  work as on Linux. Teeth-click gestures need the raw ~200 Hz stream and are not available.
* **Camera hand gestures** (`mousepods on hands`): thumb+index pinch = click, held = drag; thumb+middle = right
  click; thumb+ring = scroll mode; fist = pause. The camera runs only while mouse control is active.
* **Guided capture.** `uv run --project /path/to/mousepods python -m macos_motion record` records the raw stream
  while prompting turns, nods and tilts (saved to `captures/private/`).

## Status: what is real, what is not

| | |
|---|---|
| ✅ AirPods 3 motion stream (RemoteHID), up to ~210 Hz | verified on hardware |
| ✅ AirPods Pro 2 motion stream (SensorDataWX), ~100 Hz with the default 10 ms interval | verified on hardware |
| ✅ Mouse mode (head and bud in hand), app, shortcuts | tried on hardware, still being tuned. 159 automated tests (protocol, engine under random orientations, calibration, replay of real captures) |
| ⚠️ Pointer mode with corner calibration | tested in simulation only |
| ⚠️ Glide mode | works stroke by stroke. On real slides: drift of 4 cm over 5 strokes after tuning, on **one** capture. A bud is round and rolls, and its sensors freeze when it lies still: it will never match an optical mouse |
| ✅ Head tracking for simulators via opentrack | tried in a game: Assetto Corsa under Proton on Bazzite (AirPods Pro 2, opentrack inside the game's prefix) |
| ⚠️ Virtual joystick for native games | packet format, joystick and angle maths tested; not yet tried in a game |
| ⚠️ Garmin watch as a mouse (optional module) | first tests on hardware. Accelerometer only, 25 Hz: see below |
| ❌ Case as a mouse (buds inside) | impossible on AirPods 3: the sensors are powered off in the case |
| ⚠️ macOS via CoreMotion (AirPods Pro 2) | motion stream (~25 Hz), axes and mouse mode tried on hardware; pointer mode across displays, shortcuts and stem press built and unit-tested, not yet tried |
| ❓ Apple PnP DeviceID | changed before the first success; probably not needed (the MTU is), not isolated yet |
| ❓ Other models (AirPods 2, Pro 1, Max) | untested |

## Head tracking for simulators

AirPods 3 and AirPods Pro as a **TrackIR**: the in-game camera follows your head. Page **Simulateurs**
in the app (or `--opentrack`, `--sim-joystick`):

* **opentrack** output ("UDP over network", 127.0.0.1:4242), then opentrack's Wine/Proton output for
  DCS, MSFS, IL-2, Elite Dangerous… (FreeTrack + TrackIR), or its X-Plane / FlightGear outputs;
* a **virtual joystick** ("MousePods head tracker", same axes as opentrack's libevdev output) for native
  Linux games that bind the camera to axes: Euro Truck Simulator 2, American Truck Simulator, War Thunder…

Angles come from the buds' own orientation quaternion, checked against the gyroscope on a real capture:
pitch and roll do not drift, yaw is recentered with one click. Rotation only (3 DoF).
Step-by-step guide and what was found: **[docs/SIMS.md](docs/SIMS.md)**.

## Garmin watch as a mouse (optional)

A Garmin watch can drive the cursor too: **tilt your wrist** to move, **double-tap the watch** to click, drop your arm
to pause. It has its own page in the app (**Garmin**: connect, guided 5-pose calibration with a live tilt dot,
Recentrer / Recalibrer tout / Pause, speed, dead zone, smoothing, tap force, joystick or pointer mode) and a
standalone window.

```bash
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements-garmin.txt      # optional: garmin-ble (AGPL-3.0) + bleak
bluetoothctl                                          # once, phone Bluetooth off (one BLE client only)
  scan le
  pair XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
  trust XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
.venv/bin/python airpods_mouse_controller.py --ui     # then page "Garmin", enter the address, "Connecter"
.venv/bin/python -m garmin.garmin_mouse --address XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX   # or the standalone window
```

Limits: the watch streams **only its accelerometer** in real time (24.9 Hz, 3 samples every 120 ms, 12-bit, no
gyroscope), so the cursor follows the **tilt** of the wrist, not its rotation, with about 0.2 s of delay. Good for
pointing, not for games. What was tried to get more (services 17 SPAM and 18 BMX_RAW, the Garmin Connect app, a
Connect IQ app) and every measurement: **[docs/GARMIN.md](docs/GARMIN.md)**.

The Bluetooth link uses [garmin-ble](https://github.com/gwerneckp/garmin-ble), which is **AGPL-3.0-only**. It is not
bundled and no code from it is copied: it is installed separately, and only the Garmin module imports it.
MousePods stays Apache-2.0; if you redistribute it *together with* garmin-ble, that combination is under the AGPL-3.0.

## Built with Claude

I reverse-engineered this together with **Claude** (Anthropic), used as an AI pair engineer in Claude Code. In one afternoon, Claude:
- ran the Bluetooth probes and the ~300 blind attempts that failed;
- sent background agents through LibrePods, the Wireshark dissector, the OpenHuilian clone firmware (static disassembly) and the iOS `RemoteHID.framework` pseudocode;
- found the MTU and RemoteHID keys, wrote the controller, the app and the tests;
- kept the [journal](docs/JOURNAL.fr.md) of every attempt.

I held the AirPods, made the calls and checked every result on real hardware. The method, failures included, is in the journal.
